# ConwaysGameOfLife
Interactive "game of life" simulator in Java and Javascript with use of my little experimental WebEngineApp framework. The algorithm author is J.H. Conway.

Relax and learn a simple and genius concept of cellular automatons. You can set up the field size, change cells' status or place a whole well-known figure on the field to see it working.
